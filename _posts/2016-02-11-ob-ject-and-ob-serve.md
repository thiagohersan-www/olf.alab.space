We’re a group of artists, technologists and researchers, loosely working under the name Object Liberation Front, who get together to discuss non-anthropocentric Artificial Intelligence and its implications to the social imaginary.

Given the complex relationships that humans have today with both “natural” systems (as evidenced by global warming), and engineered systems (internet as surveillance), we have been compelled into imagining a world without humans, or, at least, a world where the division between humans/nonhumans, as well as divisions between nature/culture, sciences/humanities, matter/thought, don’t make as much sense as they used to.

Alex Pearl will present work that looks at the relationship between breakdown in machines and people. Radamés Ajna and Thiago Hersan will present ongoing work that deals with the hidden lives of our communication technologies. Sam Skinner will present a constellation of text-based prints and ephemera drawn from archival research, conversations with former Liverpool observatory employees, and his project notebooks.
