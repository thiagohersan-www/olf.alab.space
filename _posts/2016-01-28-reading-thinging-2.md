In this session we explored [Parapoetics](http://www.brokendimanche.eu/new-page-2/) and mechanical systems as ways to approach non-human, non-anthropocentric reading and writing systems.

Readings for this session included texts by [Morten SÃ¸ndergaard](http://www.brokendimanche.eu/shop-1/suture), [Aaron M. Moe](http://www.brokendimanche.eu/shop-1/protean-poetics), [a rawlings](http://www.brokendimanche.eu/shop-1/the-great-white-north) and [Alfred Kempe](http://tmp.thiagohersan.com/tmp/OLF-RT/Kempe_howToDrawStraightLines.pdf), as well as [machines](http://kmoddl.library.cornell.edu/tutorials/04/) from the [Cornell University Kinematic Models Digital Library](http://kmoddl.library.cornell.edu/).

We also built a simple system for creating and exploring different types of [linkages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_(mechanical)), and [straight-line mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line_mechanism).
