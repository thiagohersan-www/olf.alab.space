Taking the closing of the [Follow](http://fact.co.uk/follow) exhibition as inspiration, this session explored themes of post-humanism and post-internet networks.

Reading for this session included texts by [Dorion Sagan](http://tmp.thiagohersan.com/tmp/OLF-RT/Sagan_intro_to_umwelt.pdf), [Bonnie Bassler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVfmUfr8VPA), [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/) and [Stafford Beer](http://tmp.thiagohersan.com/tmp/OLF-RT/Beer__From_The_Cybernetic_Factory.pdf).

The discussion session started with short physical rituals for clearing the mind and reseting the body, collectively proposed by every participant.
