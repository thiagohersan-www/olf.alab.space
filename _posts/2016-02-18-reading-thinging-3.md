Taking the closing of the [Follow](http://fact.co.uk/follow) exhibition as inspiration, this session explored themes of post-humanism and post-internet networks.

Reading for this session included texts by [Dorion Sagan](https://www.docdroid.net/eDVpy9U/sagan-uexkull-intro-pdf), [Bonnie Bassler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVfmUfr8VPA), [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/) and [Stafford Beer](https://www.docdroid.net/spEaFSo/pickering-cybernetic-brain-pdf).

The discussion session started with short physical rituals for clearing the mind and reseting the body, collectively proposed by every participant.
