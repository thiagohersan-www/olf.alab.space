The first Reading and Thinging session considered themes of image, spectacle and technology within the [Follow](http://www.fact.co.uk/follow) exhibition through an exploration of phenomenas of light and vision; in particular the difference between reflection, refraction and diffraction.

Readings for the first session included texts by [Donna Haraway](https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/configurations/v002/2.1haraway.html), [Karen Barad](http://humweb.ucsc.edu/feministstudies/faculty/barad/barad-posthumanist.pdf), [Iris van der Tuin](http://www.academia.edu/7636218/Diffraction_as_a_Methodology_for_Feminist_Onto-Epistemology_On_Encountering_Chantal_Chawaf_and_Posthuman_Interpellation_2014_) and [Esther Leslie](http://www.animateprojects.org/writing/essay_archive/e_leslie_2).

We also learned how to play [Cat’s Cradle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_cradle) and discussed the Follow exhibition using the ideas and terminology presented in the texts.
