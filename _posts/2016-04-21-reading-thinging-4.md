As a continuation from last session's discussion of the environment and post-human networks, we present Technoshamanism: the openly-defined mix of technology, networks, nature, indigenous culture and ancestral knowledge. The term itself will mean different things to different people, but the common theme is that there is pre-digital (and ancestral/ancient) technology that should be recognized as Technology, and understood in contemporary terms.

Readings for this session included texts by [Fabiane M. Borges](http://www.modspil.dk/docs/technoshamanism_fabi_borges.pdf), [Pedro Soler](http://root.ps/download/tecnomagxs/Soler_tecnomagxs_eng.pdf), and audio by [David Hendy](https://beta.prx.org/stories/100722) and [Matt Thompson](https://beta.prx.org/stories/101979).

During the discussion session we also de-soldered old electronic equipment to free the components from their broken boards.
